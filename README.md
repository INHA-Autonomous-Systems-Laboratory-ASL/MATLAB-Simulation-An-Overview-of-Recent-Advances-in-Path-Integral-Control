# MATLAB-Simulation-An-Overview-of-Recent-Advances-in-Path-Integral-Control
This is the code repository of a tutorial overview of Path Integral (PI) approaches for stochastic optimal control and trajectory optimization. Different case studies were performed in MATLAB to demonstrate the effectiveness of stochastic control method for trajectory optimization.
